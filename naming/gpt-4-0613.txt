"Neurolens"

"Neurolens" encapsulates both the technical and the appealing aspects of your application. It's derived from combining 'neural networks' and 'lens', which can imply 'insight' or 'comparison'. The technical implications appeal to your more tech-inclined users, while the metaphorical meanings can spark the interest of less-technical users. 

Firstly, this name has an overt nod to the use of artificial intelligence models. "Neuro-" implies neural networks, a central component of many popular AI systems. It indicates that the application utilizes advanced, intelligent algorithms, which is appealing from a marketing perspective.

Secondly, "-lens" indicates a tool for examination or focus, much in the same way your app allows users to scrutinize and compare different AI responses. It implies clarity and insight, which always carries a positive connotation.

Visually, Neurolens has a balance and symmetry to it that makes it pleasing to the eye on-screen. It also maintains some level of intrigue and uniqueness, making it more likely to stand out in the App Store.

In publicity, Neurolens presents great opportunities. It can be marketed with visuals of magnifying glasses bringing AI into focus, or other imagery associated with vision and clarity.

Overall, Neurolens signifies a clear, focused examination of complex AI systems - something your application provides. It's catchy, simple but versatile, appealing to both technical and non-technical users alike and would perform well on the crowded app marketplace.
