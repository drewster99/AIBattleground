My top choice for the app name is **"AI Arena."**

### Narrative:

"AI Arena" is concise, memorable, and perfectly captures the spirit of what the app offers: a controlled and competitive space where AI models "battle" or are tested against one another. While playful, the term "arena" also carries a serious and focused undertone, resonating with both technical and non-technical audiences. It suggests a place for performance comparison, emphasizing fairness and rigor in testing. 

On a practical level:
- **Discoverability:** It's short, easy to type, and has an elegant resonance when displayed on the Mac App Store or in branding.
- **Clarity:** Non-technical users will immediately grasp that it's about comparing AI models in some capacity, while technical users will appreciate the competitive and performance-oriented overtones.
- **Marketability:** The name lends itself well to attention-grabbing marketing copyâ€”e.g., "Step into the AI Arena and let the AIs face off head-to-head!"
- **Scalability:** The name can grow with the app if additional features or other tools are introduced down the line.

Whether you're curious or running serious technical evaluations, "AI Arena" invites users to engage in both fun exploration and rigorous analysis.
