### Justification for the Chosen Name:
**AI Synthesis** was chosen after considering several factors:

1. **Descriptive Quality**: The term "synthesis" communicates the app’s fundamental function - combining or synthesizing the features and outputs of various AI models into a single interface. This name describes its capability to integrate and juxtapose responses from diverse AI services effectively.
