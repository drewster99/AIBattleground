The best name for your macOS app is: **Prompt Arena**.

### Why This Name?
**Prompt Arena** perfectly aligns with your app's essence, balancing creativity and utility while being marketable to both technical and non-technical audiences. Here's why I selected it:

1. **Descriptive Yet Concise**:  
   - The word *Prompt* signals that the app revolves around engaging with AI models through input prompts, directly tying to its core functionality.  
   - The word *Arena* conveys a competitive, dynamic space where models "compete" or perform, perfectly capturing the "head-to-head model combat" theme described.  

2. **Memorable and Catchy**:  
   - It's easy to remember, only two words, and has a rhythmic sound. The juxtaposition of "Prompt" (intellectual) and "Arena" (energetic and competitive) makes it engaging and hard to forget.

3. **Appeals to a Diverse Audience**:  
   - **Technical users**: The name immediately evokes intrigue by promising a structured, feature-rich "arena" for comparing technical outputs.
   - **Non-technical users**: It's approachable and fun, suggesting something interactive and accessible without sounding overly academic or intimidating.

4. **Mac App Store Optimization (ASO)**:  
   - Short, straightforward names perform better in search rankings. Potential users searching for terms like "AI Prompt Comparison" or "AI Tools" would naturally gravitate toward something like *Prompt Arena*.  
   - The two-word structure lends itself well to high search visibility, unlike more abstract or long-winded names.

5. **Marketing Versatility**:  
   - *Prompt Arena* aligns well with creative marketing campaigns. Visual imagery of a gladiator-style "arena" where AI models face off resonates with the "comparison" functionality while also piquing interest.  
   - Slogans like "Step Into the Prompt Arena" or "Where AI Models Go Head-to-Head!" practically write themselves, making it easy to build brand personality.  

6. **Professional + Fun**:  
   - Strikes the perfect balance. It feels serious enough to position itself as a powerful, useful tool (appropriate for developers, AI enthusiasts, and researchers) while still inviting casual experimentation and exploration.

By bridging fun with utility and carving out a visually and conceptually exciting identity, **Prompt Arena** is a surefire winner to help your app stand out in the Mac App Store and beyond.
