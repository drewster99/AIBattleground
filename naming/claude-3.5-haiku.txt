After carefully analyzing the README and considering the app's purpose, I've selected three potential names:

Top 3 Choices:
1. ModelMesh
2. AIDuel
3. PrompTitan

Detailed Analysis and Final Selection:

üèÜ Winner: "AIDuel"

Rationale:
- Perfectly captures the "head-to-head" competitive nature of the app
- Short, memorable, and immediately communicative
- Suggests both playfulness ("duel") and serious comparison
- Easy to pronounce and spell
- Works well for both technical and non-technical audiences
- Visually appealing and distinctive
- Suggests the app's core functionality of comparing AI models
- SEO-friendly and likely to rank well in App Store searches
- Implies a sense of excitement and dynamic interaction
- Hints at the "challenge mode" concept without being too technical
- Has potential for clever marketing taglines like "Draw your AI at dawn"

The name "AIDuel" strikes an ideal balance between describing the app's technical purpose and creating an engaging, memorable brand identity. It transforms the technical task of AI model comparison into something that feels like an interactive, exciting experience.

Marketing Tagline: "AIDuel: Where AI Models Compete, You Decide."

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this recommendation?
