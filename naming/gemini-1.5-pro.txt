My choice for the app name is **Prompt Arena**.

Here's why:

* **Concise and Memorable:**  "Prompt Arena" is short, punchy, and easy to remember. It avoids being overly technical while still hinting at the core functionality.
* **Descriptive yet Evocative:** The word "Prompt" directly relates to the core function of the app â€“ prompting AI models. "Arena" suggests a competitive testing ground, aligning with the comparison aspect and adding a touch of playful seriousness.  It avoids the overly aggressive connotation of "battleground" while still conveying the competitive analysis aspect.
* **Broad Appeal:**  Both technical users and non-technical users can easily understand the name.  "Prompt" is becoming increasingly common in everyday language, and "Arena" is a universally recognized concept.
* **Marketing and Discoverability:** "Prompt Arena" is easy to search for in the Mac App Store. It also lends itself well to marketing campaigns, allowing for taglines like "Step into the Prompt Arena" or "Where AI Models Compete." It evokes imagery that is easy to use in marketing materials.
* **Visual Appeal:** The name looks clean and professional on the screen.  It has a good balance of letters and doesn't feel cramped or overly long.


I considered "AI Gauntlet" and "Model Matchup" as well, but ultimately "Prompt Arena" hit the sweet spot of being informative, intriguing, memorable, and marketable. It positions the app as a powerful yet accessible tool for anyone working with AI language models.
