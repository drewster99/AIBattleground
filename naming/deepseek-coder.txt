### Evaluation of Each Name:

1. **Prompt Arena**  
   - **Resonance**: Appeals to both technical and non-technical users. "Prompt" is a familiar term in the AI space, while "Arena" conveys competition and fun.  
   - **Descriptiveness**: Clearly hints at the app’s core functionality—testing prompts across models.  
   - **Memorability**: Short, punchy, and easy to remember.  
   - **App Store Visibility**: Likely to rank well in searches for "AI prompt tools" or "AI comparison apps."  
   - **Marketing Potential**: The name lends itself to playful yet professional branding, with imagery of a competitive arena or stage.  

2. **Model Matchup**  
   - **Resonance**: Slightly more technical, but still accessible. "Model" is a key term for AI enthusiasts, while "Matchup" suggests comparison.  
   - **Descriptiveness**: Directly conveys the app’s purpose of comparing AI models.  
   - **Memorability**: Easy to recall, though slightly less dynamic than "Prompt Arena."  
   - **App Store Visibility**: Strong for searches involving "AI model comparison."  
   - **Marketing Potential**: Works well for a more serious, tool-focused audience.  

3. **AI Showdown**  
   - **Resonance**: Fun and engaging, but leans more casual. Might not fully convey the app’s utility as a serious tool.  
   - **Descriptiveness**: Suggests competition but doesn’t explicitly highlight the prompt or model comparison aspect.  
   - **Memorability**: Very catchy, but potentially too playful for some users.  
   - **App Store Visibility**: Could get lost among other "AI" and "Showdown" branded apps.  
   - **Marketing Potential**: Great for a gamified angle, but less suited for positioning as a professional tool.

### Final Choice: **Prompt Arena**

**Why Prompt Arena?**  
This name strikes the perfect balance between fun and functionality. It’s descriptive enough to convey the app’s purpose (testing prompts across AI models) while being engaging and memorable. The word "Arena" evokes a sense of competition and exploration, which aligns with the app’s "Challenge Mode" and head-to-head comparisons. It’s short, easy to spell, and will perform well in App Store searches. Additionally, it’s versatile enough to appeal to both technical users (developers, AI enthusiasts) and non-technical users (creatives, professionals).  

From a marketing perspective, "Prompt Arena" lends itself to creative branding—imagine a sleek, modern logo with a subtle arena or stage motif, and taglines like "Step into the Arena of AI" or "Where Prompts Compete." It positions the app as both a serious tool and an exciting platform for experimentation.
