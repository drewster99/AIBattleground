After carefully reviewing the README file and considering marketing best practices, I have chosen "Prompt Arena" as the app name. 

Here's why I believe "Prompt Arena" is an excellent choice:

Brevity - It's short, simple, and easy to remember. This will make it easier for people to find the app and talk about it.

Descriptiveness - "Arena" conveys the sense of competition between different AI models, while "prompt" connects it to the function of sending prompts. Together they clearly communicate the core purpose of the app.

Fun and energetic - The word "arena" brings to mind excitement and action, positioning the app as lively and engaging rather than dull and technical. This creates intrigue and fuels word of mouth.

Scope for marketing - While descriptive, "Prompt Arena" remains flexible enough for great taglines like "Where AI models battle it out" or "Enter the arena. Send your prompt." This allows catchy and viral marketing messages.  

Distinctiveness - It's unique enough to stand out from other apps in the productivity category. The name will help drive search traffic and downloads.

I believe "Prompt Arena" hits the right notes of being descriptive yet distinct, serious yet energetic. It conveys both the competitive element and prompt-based functionality. The name communicates quality while lending itself well to marketing campaigns. This will drive strong app store conversions and fuel growth through word-of-mouth.
