Based on the provided information and the criteria you've outlined, I've carefully considered several options and have selected what I believe to be the best name for your application:

"Prompt Arena"

Here's why I believe "Prompt Arena" is an excellent choice:

1. Descriptive: The name accurately conveys the core functionality of the app - a place where prompts are put to the test against multiple AI models.

2. Memorable: It's short, catchy, and easy to remember, which is crucial for word-of-mouth marketing and discoverability.

3. Dual Appeal: "Arena" suggests both a competitive aspect (appealing to tech enthusiasts who want to compare models) and a testing ground (appealing to professionals seeking to evaluate AI responses).

4. Versatility: While it hints at the app's primary function, it's not so specific that it limits future expansions or features.

5. App Store Optimization: The inclusion of "Prompt" makes it relevant to search queries related to AI and language models, improving discoverability in the Mac App Store.

6. Marketing Potential: The name lends itself well to engaging marketing campaigns, such as "Enter the Prompt Arena" or "Who will emerge victorious in today's Prompt Arena challenge?"

7. Visual Appeal: It's concise enough to look good as an app icon or in marketing materials, and it's easy to create a visually striking logo around this concept.

8. Broad Appeal: The term "Arena" is understood across various cultures and languages, making it suitable for a global audience.

"Prompt Arena" effectively balances the serious utility of the tool with a sense of excitement and engagement, making it appealing to both technical and non-technical users. It conveys the app's core purpose while leaving room for imagination and expansion, making it an ideal choice for your macOS application.
