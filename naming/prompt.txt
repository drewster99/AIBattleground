Hello. You are an expert in digital product design and marketing, and in public communications.. We've written a macOS app with a working name of "AI Battleground".  This is just a working name, so do not let it influence your decision making process. Below this text, I am going to paste the full text of the README.md file in the project, which provides a pretty fair and accurate summary of the project.  What I'd like you to do is help us pick a name for app.  It needs to be a good name.  Based on digital app marketing best practices, it should be a truly excellent name. My suggestions are to make a name that's not too long, is descriptive in some way, is memorable, and ideally, conveys the sense that it is both sort of fun to play with, but also a serious and helpful tool.  However, that's just my suggestion.  I am not an expert in marketing.  I'd like the app to be on the Mac App Store.  Please think carefully about your answer.  I think you should just pick a single name as an answer - your very best choice. Since you are an expert in product marketing and communications, I know you will choose well.  However, before you respond, pick your top 3 choices.  Then, for each choice, consider how the name would resonate with both technical and non-technical people, think about how well it conveys the various meanins intended, think about how it will look on the screen, think about how easy it will be ti find in the app store, and even think a bit about how you  might market it.  Once you've considered these things about these 3 app name choices, pick your very best one.  Respond with your very best app name and provide a brief narrative as to why you've chosen it.  The narrative should be short, but convincing.  If we pick your name, you will win the marketing contract, which is very lucrative for you and your company.  Do not lie about anything.
