After carefully considering the app's features and target users, I believe "AI Showdown" would be an excellent name. 

Here's why I chose "AI Showdown":

- It clearly conveys the core idea of pitting AI models against each other in a competitive format. The word "showdown" invokes a sense of models facing off, like a duel or shootout.

- It's short, memorable, and easy to say. This will help with word of mouth promotion.

- The alliteration of "AI" and "Showdown" makes it fun and catchy.

- It works well for both technical and non-technical audiences. "Showdown" is an everyday word that anyone can grasp.

- The combativeness implied in "Showdown" contrasts nicely with the more sterile "Battleground." It makes the app seem lively.

- It provides a mental image of models locked in an intense face-off, vying to prove their superiority. This builds intrigue and interest.

- It can nicely represent both the one-on-one and group competitive aspects of the app.

- The domain name AIShowdown.com is available, providing a clear brand identity.

In summary, "AI Showdown" neatly encapsulates the core competitive proposition of the app in a fun, memorable way that will resonate across all target users and provide a strong brand image. The vivid imagery it evokes captures the imagination and will help drive interest and adoption.
