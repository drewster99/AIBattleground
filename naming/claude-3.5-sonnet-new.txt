After careful analysis, I recommend the name: "PromptArena"

Here's why this name is the optimal choice:

"PromptArena" perfectly balances several key marketing and functional aspects:

1. Descriptive Clarity: "Prompt" directly references the app's core function with AI prompts, while "Arena" elegantly captures the comparison/testing aspect without being aggressive.

2. Professional yet Playful: The name maintains professional credibility for business users while incorporating an element of engagement through the "Arena" metaphor, suggesting a space for meaningful competition and evaluation.

3. Memorability: It's concise, rhythmic, and easy to remember, with natural alliteration that makes it stick in users' minds.

4. App Store Optimization: The word "Prompt" helps with relevant search discovery, while being unique enough to stand out in search results. It's not generic like "AI" or "Test," which would get lost in the noise.

5. Brand Extension Potential: The name can easily support future features and marketing campaigns around the concept of an "arena" for AI testing and evaluation.

This name effectively communicates both the utility and the competitive testing aspect of your application while maintaining a professional tone that will appeal to both technical and business users.
